Machine learning (ML) is a fascinating field within artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time. Here are the key points about machine learning:

Learning from Data:
ML algorithms learn patterns and relationships from data rather than being explicitly programmed.
By analyzing examples, ML models generalize and make predictions or decisions.


Types of Machine Learning:

Supervised Learning: The model learns from labeled data (input-output pairs). It predicts outputs for new, unseen inputs.

Unsupervised Learning: The model learns from unlabeled data. It discovers patterns, clusters, or structures in the data.

Reinforcement Learning: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
